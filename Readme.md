## Still in early development

This gem is still in development and will most likely change dramatically. Keep this in mind if you plan to use this in a production environment as its not recommended.

The gem is only tested against the AU region currently.

## Installation

Add the following to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "zeebox"
```

Add a file `config/initializers/zeebox.rb` containing:

```
Zeebox.configure do |config|
  config.id = 'akdwad'
  config.key = '24144de132cb2d622bzxz60a90ggasffcc6c5c'
  config.region = 'AU'
end
```
At the moment you should include this file in your app.
